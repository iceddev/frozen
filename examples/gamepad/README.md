# racegame

## Getting started

To get your environment set up, you need `node` and `npm`

Install [`volo`](http://volojs.org/)

```bash
> npm install -g volo
```

Then use `volo create` to start a new project

```bash
> volo create new_project frozenjs/boilerplate
```

## Development

During development, an error will be thrown because `dist/game.js` doesn't exist

However, we check to see if it is loaded and use the dojo loader if it isn't

We also note in the console that is happening

During development, work in the `src/` directory and make small modules

You can start a development server with linting and auto-reload using the `volo grunt` command in your terminal, which will open your default browser to 0.0.0.0:8000

Your browser will auto-reload when you make changes to files

## Building

Once you are ready to deploy your project, you can build with the `volo grunt build` command

This command will crawl your dependency tree, starting with `src/game.js` and build a single file `dist/game.js.uncompressed.js`

It will also minify your file with Google Closure Compiler into `dist/game.js`

You shouldn't have to make any changes to your `index.html` for this file to start working

## Removing Build and/or Dependencies

You can remove the files generated by the `volo grunt dojo` (`dist/` and `libs/`) by running `volo grunt clean:dist`

You can remove `deps/` and `node_modules/` by running `volo grunt clean:deps`

You can remove `dist/`, `libs/`, `deps/`, and `node_modules/` by running `volo grunt clean:all`

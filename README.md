Frozen <sup>v0.3.0</sup>
========================
[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/iceddev/frozen.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/iceddev/frozen)

## What is Frozen?

Frozen is an open-source HTML5 game engine delivering ease-of-use, rapid development through tooling and modularity.

Our goal is to apply techniques used in building modern webapps to game development, such as AMD modules, dependency management, build process, and project scaffolding.

## Get Frozen

* Frozen (single file - AMD loader included)<br>
[Development](https://raw.github.com/iceddev/frozen/master/dist/frozen.js.uncompressed.js) and
[Production](https://raw.github.com/iceddev/frozen/master/dist/frozen.js)

* Frozen Source (individual modules - bring your own loader or use Dojo)<br>
Use `volo add iceddev/frozen` to add it to your project<br>
or grab the zip: [Frozen Source](https://github.com/iceddev/frozen/archive/master.zip) (but don't forget your dependencies)

* Or just use the boilerplate!<br>
Use `volo create your_project iceddev/frozen-dev-boilerplate` which will scaffold out a new project for you and install all dependencies

## Documentation

Documentation is available at http://frozenjs.com/doc/

## Examples

Play examples at http://frozenjs.com/examples/<br>
Examples source code can be found at https://github.com/iceddev/frozen/tree/master/examples

## Source

## Browser Support

We have tested in:

* Chrome 25 & 27-dev
* Firefox 19.0.2
* IE10 (sound with supported codecs)
* Chrome for Android 25 & Beta 26 (limited sound support)
* Firefox for Android 19.0.2, Beta 20 & 21.0a2 (There is a bug in Dojo touch event handling that breaks on mobile FF, We are working towards landing a patch)
* PhantomJS 1.8.1

__Most modern browsers should support this game engine if they support canvas, but YMMV with sounds__

## Rapid Development Through Tooling

Our Frozen Box2d Editor is available at http://phated.github.com/frozen-editor/

## Technologies behind Frozen

While builds of Frozen may be tiny, we use some libraries and technologies behind the scenes as to not reinvent the wheel.

These technologies include:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) - used for dependecy mangement for our build process and development workflow
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - task runner for our development workflow, and allows for a single entry point into development configuration
* [Volo](http://volojs.org/) - clientside dependency management and project scaffolding tool
* [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) - used for AMD loader and some utility modules inside the library, Dojo build process is used to build a single JS file
* [dcl](http://www.dcljs.org/) - used for generating constructors and supplying AOP convenience methods
* [Box2d](https://box2dweb.googlecode.com/) - used for physics calculations in games
* [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) - generates documentation for code
* [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) - tests all use Jasmine
* [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) - all modules are written with AMD and the single layer includes an AMD module loader

## Development

__Warning: don't run `npm install` unless you need raw source, as this will use volo to install dojo, dojo utils, dcl, and Box2D__

### Dependencies

All development tasks depend on having dependencies installed.

Use `npm install` to get all the NPM dependencies and start the `volo add`

### Building the dist/frozen layer

`grunt build` to lint, test, doc, and run dojo build process to build the single layer

### Generating the docs

`grunt doc` will lint and generate docs

### Running the tests

`grunt test` to lint, run tests in PhantomJS and open your default browser at the test URL

### Linting the project

`grunt jshint:all` to lint the project

### Building when files change

`grunt watch:all` to execute `grunt build` whenever a file changes

## Release Notes

### <sup>v0.3.0</sup>

__Breaking Changes__

* Removed previously deprecated methods and properties
* Removed Node 0.6 support for the build process

* `Box.setAngularVelocity` function added to set the angular velocity on an entity
* Tests added for Sounds, BoxGame, and Sprite
* Added `frozen/box2d/entities` which returns a map of entity types
* Added `frozen/box2d/joints` which returns a map of joint types

__Non-Breaking Changes__

* Made all the examples adhere to the linting rules of the rest of the project
* Move linting declarations to .jshintrc to allow for JSHint being run in the directory standalone
* Update Grunt to `~0.4.1` and add/update all the dependencies in `package.json`
* Modified the Gruntfile to work with new plugins and define more tasks for convenience
* Removed Node 0.6 from tested environments
* Updated examples that were using deprecated methods
* Cleanup event handler usage on Audio implementations
* Rearranged the `specs/` file structure to match `src/`
* Implement the dcl Cleanup API for InputManager to remove event handlers on destruction
* Add declaredClass to entities and joints

__Deprecations__

* `Box.destroyJoint` has been deprecated in favor of `Box.removeJoint`

* Rewrote pointInPolygon module
* Fix some InputManager bugs
* Add more documentation
* Update examples
